# This server is a central communication hub
# for a system of household robots.

# The server provides interfaces for controlling 
# and monitoring the robots.

# One control setup is through an http API - in principle, this provides an interface 
# for external monitoring and control of the drone system.

# A second interface is provided through a flight controller, connected to a standard xbox controller.
